## Project Overview  

The Hospital Patient Management API allows CRUD operations for managing hospital-related data, including:

- Doctors ‚Äì Manage medical staff details and specializations
- Patients ‚Äì Maintain comprehensive patient information
- Appointments ‚Äì Schedule and track patient-doctor consultations
- Medical Records ‚Äì Store patient diagnosis and treatment history
- Billing ‚Äì Manage financial transactions and payment status

---

## Data Models and Relationships  

### 1. Department  
- Fields: `id`, `name (unique)`, `description`  
- Relationships: One-to-Many with Doctors  

### 2. Doctor  
- Fields: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `specialization`, `phone_number`, `email (unique)`, `department (FK)`  
- Relationships: Many-to-One with Department, One-to-Many with Appointments  

### 3. Patient  
- Fields: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `date_of_birth`, `phone_number`, `email (unique)`, `address`  
- Relationships: One-to-Many with Appointments and Medical Records  

### 4. Appointment  
- Fields: `id`, `patient (FK)`, `doctor (FK)`, `date`, `reason`, `status (Scheduled/Completed/Cancelled)`  
- Relationships: Many-to-One with Patient and Doctor  

### 5. Medical Record  
- Fields: `id`, `patient (FK)`, `doctor (FK)`, `diagnosis`, `treatment`, `created_at`  
- Relationships: Many-to-One with Patient and Doctor  

### 6. Billing

## Serializers  

Each model has its own serializer for:
- Converting model instances to JSON.
- Validating incoming data before saving.

### Example Validation Rules:
- Email addresses must be unique across doctors and patients
- Phone numbers must follow international format standards
- Appointment dates cannot be in the past
- Bill amounts cannot be negative

---

## Views and Viewsets  

We implemented **DRF `ModelViewSet`** for each model, offering complete CRUD operations.  

Example:  

```python
class DoctorViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Doctor.objects.all()
    serializer_class = DoctorSerializer
```



## Available Actions for Each Endpoint

LIST** ‚Üí `GET /api/doctors/` ‚Äì Retrieve all records  
CREATE** ‚Üí `POST /api/doctors/` ‚Äì Create new record  
RETRIEVE** ‚Üí `GET /api/doctors/{id}/` ‚Äì Get single record  
UPDATE** ‚Üí `PUT /api/doctors/{id}/` ‚Äì Full update  
PARTIAL_UPDATE** ‚Üí `PATCH /api/doctors/{id}/` ‚Äì Partial update  
DESTROY** ‚Üí `DELETE /api/doctors/{id}/` ‚Äì Delete record  

---

## URL Patterns  

The API endpoints are registered via a DRF `DefaultRouter`:  

| Endpoint                | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `/api/departments/`     | Manage departments |
| `/api/doctors/`         | Manage doctors |
| `/api/patients/`        | Manage patients |
| `/api/appointments/`    | Manage appointments |
| `/api/medicalrecords/`  | Manage medical records |
| `/api/bills/`           | Manage billing |

---

## Comprehensive Testing  

We conducted thorough testing using **Postman** to validate all CRUD operations and edge cases:  

- `GET` ‚Äì Fetch all / single records  
- `POST` ‚Äì Create new record  
- `PUT / PATCH` ‚Äì Update record  
- `DELETE` ‚Äì Remove record
